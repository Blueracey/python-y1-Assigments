Footnotes:
1,"All census metropolitan area (CMA) and non-CMA gross domestic product (GDP) add up to the provincial GDP figures in current prices. However, there may be a lag between the CMA figures and the latest available provincial GDP measures."
2,"Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita can be estimated by dividing GDP by population. Population estimates by census metropolitan area and non-metropolitan area are available in tables 17-10-0005 and 17-10-0135."
3,"This table reflects the conversion of the experimental estimates for 2001 to 2009 published in table 36-10-0423 in November 2014 into an annual product. Moving forward, the annual publication cycle will lag the reference year by approximately three and a half years, in line with the publication of the supply and use tables (table 36-10-0478). Due to differences in methodology, the estimates may not be fully coherent with the experimental estimates."
